pytest-repeat
===================

pytest-repeat is a plugin for `py.test <http://pytest.org>`_ that makes it easy
to repeat a single test, or multiple tests, a specific number of times.

Requirements
------------

You will need the following prerequisites in order to use pytest-repeat:

- Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 or PyPy
- py.test 2.4 or newer

Installation
------------
To install pytest-repeat::

  pip install pytest-repeat

Repeating a test
----------------

Use the :code:`--count` command line option to specify how many times you want
your test, or tests, to be run::

  py.test --count=10 test_file.py

Each test collected by py.test will be run :code:`count` times.

Repeating a test until failure
------------------------------

If you are trying to diagnose an intermittent failure, it can be useful to run the same
test over and over again until it fails. You can use py.test's :code:`-x` option in
conjunction with pytest-repeat to force the test runner to stop at the first failure.
For example::

  py.test --count=1000 -x test_file.py

This will attempt to run test_file.py 1000 times, but will stop as soon as a failure
occurs.

UnitTest Style Tests
--------------------

Unfortunately pytest-repeat is not able to work with unittest.TestCase test classes.
These tests will simply always run once, regardless of `--count`, and show a warning.
